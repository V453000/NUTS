0.8.4
	Greatly optimized the calculation of freight engine drawing.
	Freight wagons can no longer look like an engine.

	Monorail freight engines now draw as alternating front and rear facing engines.

	Monorail freight engine capacity was accidentally double.
	Maglev freight engine capacity was accidentally double.

0.8.3
	Improved drawing of wagon-only trains without leading engine, but with an engine inside the consist.

	Monorail freight engines are no longer dual-headed and have an articulated wagon instead. Power halved to compensate.
	MEOW class remains unchanged.
	
	Power gain per added unit for Monorail Fast class increased. Purchase menu says the base amount that is added to.

	Maglev freight engines are no longer dual-headed and have an articulated wagon instead. Power halved to compensate.

	Fixed that express wagons were called Wagon.

	When there is at least a single Express wagon in a freight train, the articulated wagons look like Express wagons when refit to express cargoes.

	Chameleon engine capacity and loadings speed increased by 50%. Wagons remain untouched.

0.8.2
	Slightly changed/simplified vehicle attaching rules:
		- Engines can no longer attach to other engines in the same class. I do not see a valid use case for this, you always want the best.
		- Superstrong engines are allowed to attach express wagons. It was a rather obscure rule. If you want your passengers to travel slowly, you can now.
		-> Now engines can only attach the same engine, or the correct wagons for them. This allows the text in the purchase menu to be removed, and error messages simplified.
	
	When multiple engines of the same type are used in one train, wagons no longer show between engines.
	Engines automatically draw at the front of the train, no matter where is the engine placed.
	Exception: When one engine is placed at the end of the train, the train looks like dual-headed, and automatically distributes engines at the front and back.
	
	When multiple engines of the same type are used in one train, visualisation shows when a real engine looks like a wagon and vice versa.

	Rail Fast class is no longer dual-headed and has an articulated wagon just like many other rail engines.
	Rail Fast class power and tractive effort (through lost weight) halved to keep balance with other rail engines.

	In the purchase menu, loading speed is written in number of stages instead of the code number.
	In the purchase menu, articulated wagons don't mention (x2) for capacity as it does not matter if you do not need to calculate the loading stages.
	In the purchase menu, rules which vehicles can the engine attach are not shown. The rules should be simple enough now, and the error messages should be clear.

	Large ship capacity increased to 54 from 45. Loading stages are still 9.

0.8.1
  Changed the 32bpp parameter to 32bpp SLUGs to make it more clear that it's not for everything.

0.8.0
  All units which could load passengers can also refit to YETI and tired YETIs now. (only with YETI Extended Town & Industries on)
    - YETI looks like mail in intercity/local trains
    - tired YETI looks like valuables/gold/diamonds in intercity/local trains
  
  Reworked the parameter controlling signals:
    - Signal graphics replaced with BRIX signals.
    - NUTS can no longer detect BRIX (this prevented BRIX to be used as a static NewGRF alongside with NUTS in multiplayer)
    - There are now two parameters controlling how singnals look:
      - Which railtypes to replace
        - None
        - WETRail
        - WETRail and PURR
        - WETRail, PURR, Rail, Electrified rail, Monorail, Maglev (all railtypes that NUTS uses) (Default)
      - Which rows of signals to replace
        - Both - replaces signals just like BRIX would (Default)
        - Semaphore - replaces only semaphore signals (the first row in the signal GUI)
        - Light - replaces only light signals (the second row in the signal GUI)
        - Semaphore in Light row - replaces only light signals, but with BRIX semaphore signals
        - Light in Semaphore row - replaces only semaphore signals, but with BRIX light signals
        - Both inverted - replaces both rows of signals, but in the opposite way than default
        
  Fixed a bunch of wrong mail/valuable capacities in Monorail Intercity.
  Fixed graphical support for YETI cargo for flatbed wagons (turned off by default, universal ones worked correctly)
  Added graphical support for tired YETI cargo for flatbed wagons.
  
  Migrated repository to https://github.com/V453000/NUTS
  

0.7.9
  32bpp/ExtraZoom removed:
    - They looked way worse than the 8bpp ones.
    - Making them look nice would take a lot more time which I don't want to put into NUTS right now
    - This gets even worse considering there are many more graphics to replace
    - They took a lot of filesize for no big reason
    - Slugs keep 32bpp, with a parameter to enable/disable it (of course you can always force 8bpp by setting blitter in openttd.cfg)
    - IF it's convenient, I will release a second version of NUTS which defines 32bpp as 0.7.8 did and upload it to devzone later.
  Added more parameter settings:
    - for disabling/enabling slug 32bpp
    - for disabling/enabling NUTS signals - separately for all semaphore signals, and for wetrail electric signals
      0 for automatic (will only disable itself when BRIX is loaded)
      1 for disabled (base set / BRIX signals will show)
      2 for enabled (NUTS signals will show)
  Fixed some other small issues I don't even remember, from what I can remember:
    - basic support for some new FIRS2.0 cargoes (unfinished, not sure what is missing)
    - some chameleon engines had broken rear engine drawing when double-headed
  This release is a candidate for eventual finished NUTS in terms of main features.
  If anything, I will rewrite the cargo wagon definitions with a more versatile system, and supporting all of the cargoes available at that time.
  Please report bugs you find, even if you already reported it in the past, I clearly forgot if it still isn't fixed.


0.7.8
	32bpp/ExtraZoom:
		Added Company Colouring to all existing 32bpp vehicles.

	Rail MEDIUM - same stats, attached wagon
	Rail FAST - dual headed, increased T.E. - should compete more easily with 2-headed Rail MEDIUM and other trains
	
	Monorail MEDIUM - double headed, double weight simply doubles the max T.E.
	Monorail FAST - had to reduce the power, reduced weight, increased T.E. coefficient
	Monorail CHAMELEON - just doubled
	Monorail MENTALLY DISTURBED - dual headed
	
	Maglev MEDIUM - dual headed
	Maglev FAST - dual headed
	
	Only to remain 0.5 tile long are LOGIC engines.

0.3.4
	Added FRVG - FIRS Fruit, formerly Fruit and Vegetables, amongst supported cargoes.
	Improved || alignment of short wagons; now they look the same in both directions.

0.3.3
	Fixed a bug where 3rd gen rail tankers only had 2 loading stages when in motion. (Moving trains looked empty when 50% full etc)

0.3.2
	All monorail cargo trains gain +1500 power, this makes especially the early monorail trains a bit stronger than before.
	Rail SuperStrong trains are now able to haul 2nd gen hoppers.
	FAST maglev trains now do not claim being MEDIUM.
	Rail SuperStrong 6 (X E Qt R) now does not need electrification.
	
0.3.1
	Maglev Flatbed - livestock redrawn, Now coming in special Holy Shit Animals edition!
	Minor fixes like glowing colours and some recolouring.
	
0.3.0
	Colours for maglev flatbed.

0.2.9
	Rail 1st gen wagon capacity increased from 20 to 24
		- to cause less difference when upgrading to 2nd gen (30)
		- to make early game less hectic, allowing to connect more industries.
		- loading speed is unchanged as of 2 (x2 for articulation), so there is one more loading stage now.
	Maglev Tankers redrawn
	Maglev Flatbed sweets now in various kinds.
	Maglev Flatbed beer (fizzy drinks) improved slightly.
	

0.2.8
	Cargo trains Express wagon capacities increased.
	Enhanced Purchase Menu:
	 - each train has a coloured number next to it. The number means it's chronological number in the train class and the colour indicates the class:
		orange = SUPERSTRONG
		blue = STRONG
		green = MEDIUM
		red = FAST
		grey = INTERCITY
		yellow = LOCAL
		and more extra icons
	 - the info on which rail trains go is also coloured now:
		grey = rail
		blue = electrified rail
		gold = monorail
		white = maglev
	Touched up sprites of Diesel Power and Duke NUT'em, also improved alignment of Duke NUT'em to other vehicles.		

0.2.7
	Making recolouring of maglev express (Meat Grinder only for now) wagons actually work.


0.2.6
	Added a new maglev local train: Meat Grinder
	 - 211 km/h maglev train with tilt means no slowdowns in curves
	 - a bit weaker acceleration than monorail local trains
	 - lower capacity than local monorail trains means that it is very useful in suburbs where traffic is low
	 - is able to recolour by refit!
	Timewave Zero loading stages increased from 2 to 3.
	Timewave Zero engine/wagon capacity decreased from 110/130 to 90/132.
	SLUG speed decreased from 211 to 177.
	Fixed some loading times so engines load as long as their wagons.
	Express wagons now inform about changing capacity and loading speed based on which engine they are hauled to.
	Maglev Intercity trains now inform about loading speeds and capacities in the purchase menu.

0.2.5
	Purchase menu information fixes and loading speed adjustments.	

0.2.4
	Major stat rework of passenger trains:
	- Maglev and Monorail INTERCITY trains swapped around. This is to make them differ a lot.
		The faster ones (monorail now) are very vulnerable to short curves but have high max throughput, being effective on clean networks.
		The slower ones (maglev now) are almost immune to slowdowns on curves but their throughput is capped a bit lower, being effective on networks where space is very limited.
	- Monorail Local speed reduced
		This way they are less overpowered in compare with Rail Local, but are even more comfortable to use than before (full speed in all curves, instant acceleration).
	- rescaled stats of Rail Local to make them more balanced
	- SLUG is slower, but with higher capacity
	"This vehicle has tilt." text made blue to be better visible as there is starting to be a lot of text.
	
	

0.2.3
	Rail local trains redrawn.
	
0.2.2
	Rail local trains have their stats majorly changed.
	Most of these changes are reducing their acceleration drastically.
	This is to make them comparably strong to monorail local trains. You get similar throughput, but you can:
		- either have trains with the same capacity as in previous versions, but with bad acceleration
		- or have trains with less capacity than in the previous versions, but with about as good acceleration as it was
	The throughput is affected the same way as reducing capacities would, but gives a little more choice.
	Also, single-engine 3 tile local trains will have considerable problems with climbing hills, while double-engine 3 tile local trains will not.

	All rail and monorail cargo wagons now have colours so you can recognize them even when empty.
	
	Minor graphical touches to RailMedium9.

0.2.1
	Rail local trains are able to refit to colour liveries.
	Now you can choose how exactly should your rail local trains look. Note that rail intercity trains also can haul these wagons, but will take no recolouring effect.
	Purchase menu sprites stay coloured, to have some difference between trains (until I redraw them to make each one look different).
	
	Loading speed info was added to the purchase menu:
	Cargo wagons have the loading speed at each wagon.
	Articulated wagons consisting of 2 segments have their loading speed wrote per segment, so the effective loading speed for the whole twin-wagon is double of that number.
	Express wagons have loading speed noted on engine as it depends which engine they are attached to
	Passenger engines have loading speed noted on the engine.
	
	3rd gen rail wagon loading speed scaled from 8 to 7 (according to the 40->35 reduction).
	
	Attach info in purchase menu was improved, now says "can haul any RAIL cargo engines or any RAIL cargo wagons", so the logic how attach allowances works is more clear.
	RailFast 2, 3 and 8 redrawn to a different drawing technique, more adjustments to come!
	Alignment of SLUG mail/gold wagons fixed.
	

0.2.0
	All maglev wagons are redrawn!
	All maglev cargo medium engines, and half of the fast engines are redrawn!
	Introduction dates adjusted - modern engines come in longer intervals.
	Last trains now come in 2069.
	Nyan cat removed from the set.
	

0.1.9
	Redrawn maglev hopper wagons.
	Modern Rail Medium trains have slightly lower power.
	3rd gen Rail wagons capacity reduced to 35 units.
	Swapped colours of stone/sugar hoppers for better variety at FIRS farms.
	Swapped colours of clay/bauxite hoppers for better difference of wagons like blue/ltblue+brown-ish clay/iron ore.

0.1.8
	2nd gen rail hoppers, 3rd gen rail hoppers and monorail hoppers now have colours too
	1st and 2nd gen rail hoppers also have 5 random liveries.
	Fixed minor graphical issues of monorail medium trains.

0.1.7
	Many new flatbed cargoes drawn for monorail flatbed wagons.
	Rail Tankers have colours now for all generations.
	1st Rail Hoppers now have colours - each cargo is different!
	1st gen rail tankers are improved and fit the new flatbeds now.
	Water in tankers shows properly now.
	3rd gen rail hoppers loading stages fixed.
	3rd gen rail wagons are back to 1990.

0.1.6
	Many visual changes to rail wagons.
	First generation Rail Flatbeds were completely redrawn.
	Second and third generation Rail Flatbeds now use more specific cargo sprites and many sprites were improved.
	Third generation Rail Hoppers have completely redrawn cargo "heaps" in them.
	Colourful 3rd gen Rail Tankers for more cargoes than just toyland.
	All third generation rail wagons moved to 2010.
	
0.1.5
	Fixed loading speeds of all passenger wagons (capacity was increased but loadspeed was not in the last change)
	Loading speeds synchronized, so trains load as quickly as wagons do.
	Rail cargo wagons now have the Designed date in the purchase menu.

0.1.4
	Maglev ICE passenger/mail capacity +20%
	Doubled capacity of all passenger/mail/gold trains. (maglev gets 20% first, doubled after)
	Maglev ICE trains acceleration slightly reduced.
	Issues with Cereals (ecs) fixed for all wagons.
	

0.1.3
	NEW generation of rail wagons - the 2nd gen flatbed, hopper, tanker and universal wagon.
		With unique sprites for ALL known cargoes including all ECS, FIRS and pikka basic industries!
	Balance changes to ICE trains for monorail and maglev - power raised significantly.
	Hopefully finally fixed issues with railflatbed1 wrong sprites when empty.
		

0.1.2
	Completely re-ordered the code of the whole newGRF so it can compile now without running out of action2 IDs.
	Added Cola, Beer and Plastic tankers for toyland - now with colours!
	Added cargo-specific Railflatbed3 Sweets.

	Added 2nd gen hoppers for rail.
	Increased capacity of Local engines to make them more viable.	
	
0.0.9

0.0.1	First alpha release version
	Many things still missing, but it is 1.4.2012 the first playable version is here! This is no joke!

			Train stats are just guessed, testing starts now!
			Many sprites are going to be enhanced and improved in future versions.
			Features like parameter settings or universal rail type are yet to come.
