NUTS UNREALISTIC TRAIN SET README

===========================================================================================================
1. INTRODUCTION
===========================================================================================================


NUTS Unrealistic Train Set is hoping to extend OpenTTD gameplay to the fullest,
attempting to offer as many various trains as possible, and also making the game
fun when playing a normal chronologically going game.
Also by adding various utility features like universal rail, universal wagons,
engine flipping or logic engines.

As this train set is a direct outcome from my experience at playing at
openttdcoop, it is vital to know the basics about it.
For more information about openttdcoop, visit us at www.openttdcoop.org

NUTS Unrealistic Train Set also has it's wiki with plenty of details

3. AUTHORS AND CONTACT
===========================================================================================================
The newGRF has so far been developed by me alone so I will write from first person perspective...

I am a long time player of OpenTTD, being very active in the circles of openttdcoop community.
I take OpenTTD from the side of playing reasonably, finding logical connections
between everything and I say that the entertainment that OpenTTD provides is mostly
given by the extreme amount of possible complexity and the variety of options
that you can discover when playing.

The NUTS Unrealistic Train Set reflects all of my gameplay experience and tries to increase the amount of possible choices
and options that the player has.

5. CREDITS
===========================================================================================================
There are many people who help me in various ways with development of the set
and I would like to give them a big thanks for that!

This means basically everybody who gives me any feedback, reports bugs,
or just talk to me about the features and mechanics of the set.

From the bottom of my heart I would like to say Thank You,
Above all planetmaker for his endless patience and help with all things I could ever think of,
andythenorth for sharing his experience with newGRF development and pixel art discussions,
Hirundo, Eddi, michi_cc, Yexo, frosch123 and Rubidium for supporting my slightly
abnormal ideas with both NML and OpenTTD itself
oberhuemer for help with coming up with name of the set.

Among the horde, I would mainly like to thank:
The players of openttdcoop, Mark, Chris Booth, MrD2DG(MrMouthy), Troy McClure, (Emperor) Jake
and anybody else who discusses things with me and have a good idea how the set works.

And last but not least I would like to thank you for not only playing with the set,
but also reading the readme till the end!

All of the above and all who I forgot to mention, thank you!
